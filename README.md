# Verilog-Clock-and-Countdown-Alarm
Verilog project that has a time of day clock (12 hours) and countdown alarm that flashes. Sorry for the awful spacing, ModelSim is bad.

The main module is in fsm.v. This controls the clock and alarm outputs. 

## ECE 3544
This project was made based on the specification [here]( Project-4-Specification.pdf) for ECE 3544 at Virginia Tech. Several files were given at the start of the project, including keypressed.v and clk.v.

## Usage
Please feel free to use this project, but I have made minor changes so the alarm clock does not work 100% so the project cannot be fully used by future ECE 3544 students without any work.
